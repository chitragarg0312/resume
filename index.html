    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated and inquisitive tech 
        enthusiast in web development
         and programming. I also have a strong
         interest in traveling, as I believe exposure
          to diverse environments fosters adaptability 
          and broadens problem-solving perspectives. 
       I am committed to lifelong learning and actively 
       seek opportunities that allow me to grow as both a
        developer and an individual. My goal is to contribute
         meaningfully to innovative, collaborative
         projects that merge technology, creativity,
         and real-world impact.
